-- Knox Life: Squirrel -- registration.
--
-- The whole spawning side of this mod. There is no generator here and no map
-- analysis: Squirrel_RouteData.lua is baked offline by the base mod's
-- tools/gen_routes.py from habitats.json, and hands its pool over with
-- registerRoutePool. All that is left is to say what this animal is and how
-- common it was.
--
-- ITS OWN GROUND. An addon species that declares no habitat inherits whichever
-- base pool its bucket falls back to, which is fine for something shaped like a
-- raccoon and wrong for this. Declaring `habitat` against a pool of our own
-- means it inherits nothing: its own terrain, its own geometry, no sharing.
